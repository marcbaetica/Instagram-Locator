# Instagram-Locator
This web application takes in a real world address and using REST calls decodes the information into geograhpical coordinates (via the google maps api) and extracts instagram pictures that were tagged around that location.

Updates: 
- included printing of latitude and longitude
- added an adjustable radius (of up to 5km) from the given location
- made images hyperlinked so that when click it sends you to the user's instagram page
